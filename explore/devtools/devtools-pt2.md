### 1. What was the bug?
The bug is that `num1` and `num2` are strings, so the type of `result` will also be string instead of a number.

### 2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use)
I added a unary plus operator to convert them into numbers, so we will get the expected results.
